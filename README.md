# First-Second-Score-From-List
Best Score:- Given a list, write a function to get first, second best scores from the list. 
List may contain duplicates.
--> 2 Approaches;

Approach 1: Using in-built functions like list(),set(),sorted()
            This is not so effiecient but good for conceptual understanding.
            TIme Complexity: O(n logn)
            Space Complexity: O(n)

Approach 2: Using logical building, Loopings, conditional statements.
            This is efficient code.
            Time Complexity: O(n)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
